- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BlaineHeffron, a full-stack developer and PhD physicist specializing in data science and blockchain technologies.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data accessibility, analysis, signal filtration, smart contract development, and machine learning applications in physics.
- ðŸŒ± Over the past year and a half, I've been working with AhaLabs on building smart contracts for EquitX and developing tooling like scaffold-stellar. I've also contributed to js-stellar-sdk, stellar-cli, and Loam, with strong expertise in Rust, smart contracts, and TypeScript.
- ðŸ’¼ I recently published a paper on using machine learning to enhance signal-to-background ratios in the PROSPECT neutrino physics experiment: [IOP Science Article](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/20/08/P08006).
